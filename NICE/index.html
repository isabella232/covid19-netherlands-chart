  Cloudflare Worker for Stichting NICE - COVID-19 infection in Dutch ICU
</title></h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  The Dutch Foundation for National Intensive Care Evaluation (Stichting NICE)
  has an overview of information related to COVID-19 cases in Intensive Care (IC):
  <a href="https://www.stichting-nice.nl/covid-19-op-de-ic.jsp">
    https://www.stichting-nice.nl/covid-19-op-de-ic.jsp
  </a>.
</p>

<p>
  The source of this information comes from 6 separate API endpoints.
  <br>
  I wanted to use this date for my COVID-19 chart but I did not feel much like
  making 6 HTTP calls for each request. To solve this, I create an API that makes
  the calls and combines them into one endpoint.

  It is mostly meant for development and testing purposes.
  For production use this Cloudflare Worker:
