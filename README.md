# History of COVID-19 cases in the Netherlands

Although there are all sorts of charts out there, I could not easily find a
chart of the historical data provided by the RIVM.

As I needed a clearly outlined task to get used to working from home, I decided
to create such a chart myself.

See it online at https://blog.pother.ca/covid19-netherlands-chart/

## Overall information

At the time of this writing (2020-03-19):

- **24.15%** of known cases have been **hospital personnel**
- **19.88%** of known cases have been **hospitalised**
- **3.09%** of known cases have been **fatal**
- The age of the fatalities lies between 63 en 95 years

The information on the RIVM site is updated daily at 14.00.

If you prefer tabular data (or are wondering where the percantages come from),
