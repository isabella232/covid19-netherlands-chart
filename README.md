# History of COVID-19 cases in the Netherlands

There are several resources that talk about ["flatten the curve"][washingtonpost-corona-simulator].

Although there are all sorts of charts out there, I could not easily find a
chart of the historical data provided by the RIVM combined with information
regarding Intensive Care cases across the Netherlands.

As I needed a clearly outlined task to get used to working from home, I decided
to create such a chart myself.

See it online at https://blog.pother.ca/covid19-netherlands-chart/
