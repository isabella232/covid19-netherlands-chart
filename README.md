# History of COVID-19 cases in the Netherlands

Although there are all sorts of charts out there, I could not easily find a
chart of the historical data provided by the RIVM.

As I needed a clearly outlined task to get used to working from home, I decided
to create such a chart myself.

See it online at https://blog.pother.ca/covid19-netherlands-chart/

## Overall information

At the time of this writing (2020-03-18):

- **23.65%** of known cases have been **hospital personnel**
- **19.89%** of known cases have been **hospitalised**
- **2.83%** of known cases have been **fatal**
- The age of the fatalities lies between 63 en 95 years

The information on the RIVM site is updated daily at 14.00.
