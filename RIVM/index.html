  Cloudflare Worker for RIVM - COVID-19 infections in the Netherlands
</title></h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)
  has an overview of information related to COVID-19 cases in the Netherlands:
  <a href="https://www.rivm.nl/nieuws/actuele-informatie-over-coronavirus">
    https://www.rivm.nl/nieuws/actuele-informatie-over-coronavirus
  </a>.
</p>

<p>
  The source of this information comes in the form of unstructured HTML.
  <br>
  I wanted to use this date for my COVID-19 chart but I did not want to manually
  update my data every day. To solve this, I create an API that parses the page
  and return JSON.
</p>

<p>
  This is an HTML representation of the Javascript code in
  <a href="./../src/RIVM.js"><code>src/RIVM.js</code></a> being executed.
</p>

<p>
  It is mostly meant for development and testing purposes.
  For production use this Cloudflare Worker:
  <a href="https://covid-19.potherca.workers.dev/RIVM/">https://covid-19.potherca.workers.dev/RIVM/</a>
</p>
